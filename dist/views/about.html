<div class="about-text"> <p>One of the most difficult concepts in CS to grasp is design patterns, and I am here to do something about that! I will be explaining design patterns in the most simplest way possible so that even someone completely new to CS would be able to understand. All suggestions are welcome! Please <a href="mailto:me@dimi.io">email me</a> or file a issue on <a href="https://github.com/dimitriwalters/js-patterns/issues">GitHub</a> if there is something better I can do.</p> </div>
